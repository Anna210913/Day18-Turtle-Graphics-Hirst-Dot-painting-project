# Day18-Turtle-Graphics-Hirst-Dot-painting-project üé®
For Day 18, we became famous painters using Python Turtle & GUI.  
We recreated the iconic **Hirst Spot Painting** which is a beautiful grid of colourful dots inspired by artist Damien Hirst. 

Each dot is painted in a random vibrant colour, and watching the program paint it feels so satisfying. We used the `turtle` module to move a pointer (‚Äúturtle‚Äù) around the screen and draw shapes, patterns, and art.

# What I learned:

-  What **Turtle Graphics** are and how to use them in Python  
-  How to read & use Python **documentation**
-  Drawing shapes with Turtle (lines, squares, polygons)
-  Working with **modules**, importing packages & using **aliases**
-  Creating dashed lines and random walks
-  Understanding **tuples** in Python
-  Generating **random RGB colours**
-  Introduction to **GUI (Graphical User Interface)** ‚Äî a way to show graphics instead of just text.

# How the code works:

- The turtle draws a grid of colourful dots (like Hirst‚Äôs style)
- Randomly picks colours from a preset palette using the RGB values for colour variety.
- The turtle moves row by row and places dots spaced evenly
- And voila, a beautiful piece of generative art is created

This day made Python feel exciting, knowing that we can do more with code than I could have ever imagined!
